    <p class="text-lg">
      I am Juan Andr√©s Losauro, a 21-year-old student pursuing a Bachelor's
      degree in Computer Engineering, currently in my third year at the
      Universidad Argentina de la Empresa (UADE).
      <br /><br />
      I have a strong passion for frontend development and fullstack technologies,
      and I am actively seeking my first professional opportunity to apply and expand
      my knowledge in a real-world environment.
      <br /><br />
      Throughout my academic journey, I have developed solid skills in key technologies
      such as React, Spring Boot, and various other tools and frameworks that are
      essential for modern software development. I am particularly drawn to the dynamic
      and ever-evolving nature of web development, where I can combine creativity
      with technical problem-solving.
      <br /><br />
      In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to continuous learning and
      improvement. I thrive on challenges that push me to grow both as a developer
      and as a professional. I am highly motivated to participate in projects that
      allow me to contribute to meaningful solutions, while also gaining valuable
      industry experience.
      <br /><br />
      My goal is to collaborate with a team that values innovation and provides opportunities
      for growth, where I can leverage my skills and enthusiasm to make a positive
      impact in the field of software development. I am eager to bring my passion
      for technology to a role where I can help drive successful projects and continue
      honing my expertise.
